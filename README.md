## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Leonardo Jimenez!

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Leo!

I am a first-generation undergraduate student at Texas State University. During my early years, I was fond of mathematics, computer science, and space, but I was never guided towards what these interests could become or what I could do with them.

During my junior year of high school, the day after filling out my application for a medical degree, I watched the movie "Interstellar." As I sat in silence with the credits rolling I realized how much I was truly drawn to my passions and curiosity. Immediately, I emailed my counselor and asked for a major change to Computer Science. Then, I watched my first-ever Python tutorial by Giraffe Academy. Ever since that moment, I have never looked back.

As I progressed in my studies, I eventually added Mathematics to my major, complementing my Computer Science focus. While my primary focus is on these two fields, my fascination with physics and aerospace still lingers as a byproduct of my Computer Science and Mathematics studies.
